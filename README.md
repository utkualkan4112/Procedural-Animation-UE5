# Procedural Locomotion System for Humanoid Characters

This project focuses on implementing a procedural locomotion system for humanoid characters in Unreal Engine using a control rig. The goal is to create more dynamic and realistic character movement by predicting the feet's location based on the character's velocity and adjusting the positions of other body parts accordingly.

## Features
- Procedural animation system that calculates the character's velocity and determines the appropriate placement of the feet.
- Adaptation of leg, torso, and other body part movements based on the change in velocity to maintain balance and create smooth, natural-looking motion.
- Implementation of stair motion, allowing the character to navigate up and down stairs seamlessly.
- Enhanced versatility of the procedural animation system to handle various terrain types.

## Development
The project is built upon the knowledge gained from the Udemy course "Procedural Animation" (https://www.udemy.com/course/procedural-animation). The course provided valuable insights and techniques that were applied and expanded upon in this project.

By leveraging the power of procedural animation and control rigs, this project aims to create more immersive and believable character movement, reducing the reliance on pre-recorded animations and enabling characters to adapt to different environments dynamically.

## Benefits
- More dynamic and realistic character movement compared to traditional pre-recorded animations.
- Reduced need for creating and managing a large number of animation assets.
- Improved adaptability of characters to different environments and terrain types.
- Enhanced immersion and believability of character motion in the game world.

## Future Enhancements
- Expansion of the procedural animation system to handle more complex movements and interactions.
- Integration with other gameplay systems, such as combat or parkour mechanics.
- Optimization of the procedural animation algorithms for improved performance.
- Incorporation of additional environmental factors, such as uneven terrain or obstacles, to further enhance the realism of character movement.
